<h1>Flex is HARD</h1>
<ul>
 <li>After trying to bend my mind around the Odin Projects flex exercises I was left in an utter state of confusion.</li>
 <li>I took the weekend to think about how I can get over this and thought I would head back to a previous project that also left me in a state of confusion.</li>
</ul>
<p>This project was one I started with FreeCodeCamp. I managed to write up all my HTML and content but the one thing I could not understand was how to connect my HTML to CSS. This led me to the Odin Project which helped massively until <strong>flex</strong> came into my life.</p>
<ul>
  <li>I created containers in the index.html page and commenced to go through each element and container one at a time.</li>
  <li>With the help of Google's inspect element and the Odin Projects flex exercise templates I started my own flex experiment.</li>
  <li>Thus my Douglas Adams page is now finished.</li>
</ul>
<p>Flex is still a confusing aspect of CSS but I will be creating other little projects of my own to help me gain more experience with it and also other aspects of CSS that I've come across doing this Douglas Adams page.</p>
