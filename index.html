              <em>Douglas Adams</em> was born in <em>Cambridge</em> on the <strong>11th March 1952</strong>. 
              Shortly after he was born his family moved to <em>East London</em> where Douglas' sister was born. 
              Both Douglas and his sister then moved to <em>Brentwood, Essex</em> with their mother after the 
              divorce of their parents in <strong>1957</strong>.

            <p class="p">
              In <strong>1959</strong>, <em>Douglas Adams</em> would go to prep school and then to main school 
              in <em>Brentwood</em> where he would be known not just for his writing skills but also his height 
              as by the age of 12 he stood at <strong>6ft 5"</strong>. <em>Adams</em> would then attend <em>St 
              John's College</em> in <em>Cambridge</em> after being awarded an Exhibition in English for writing 
              an essay on religious poetry that discussed <em>The Beatles</em> and <em>William Blake</em>. He 
              went on to graduate in <strong>1974</strong> with a <em>2:2 in English Literature</em>.

          <h3 class="h3">Tertiary phase</h3>
            <p class="p">
              After graduating in <strong>1974</strong>, <em>Adams</em> moved to <em>London</em> determined to 
              become a writer for TV and radio. Later that year <em>Adams</em> was discovered by <em>Monty
              Python's Graham Chapman</em> which led the pair to write together for a brief period. In 
              <strong>1977</strong> <em>Adams</em>, along with producer <em>Simon Brett</em>, pitched <em>The 
              Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy</em> to <em>BBC Radio 4</em>. The first series aired in
              <strong>1978</strong> which went on to be adapted into books, tv series, stage shows, a film,
              and even a video game.

            <p class="p">
              In <strong>1985</strong>, <em>Adams</em> joined a project set up by the <em>World Wide Fund for 
              Nature</em> and <em>The Observer</em> which was to raise awareness for various endangered species 
              around the world. The project started in <em>Madagascar</em> where <em>Adams</em> met with 
              zoologist, <em>Mark Carwardine</em>. With the project being successful, <em>Adams</em> and 
              <em>Carwardine</em> made a radio documentary series call <em>Last Chance to See</em>, 
               which was released in <strong>1989</strong> of which followed a book in <strong>1990</strong>. 
              During this time <em>Adams</em> also wrote the books, <em>Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective 
              Agency</em> (<strong>1987</strong>) and <em>The Long, Dark Tea Time of the Soul</em> 
              (<strong>1988</strong>). Both these books were later turned into a radio series and also a 2 
              separate tv shows.

          <h3 class="h3">Quintessential phase</h3>
            <p class="p">
              After the release of the documentary series <em>Last Chance to See</em>, <em>Adams</em> went on to 
              help with projects such as the <em>Great Ape Project</em> (created in <strong>1993</strong>) 
              and the <em>Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund</em> (created in <strong>1978</strong>). In 
              <strong>1994</strong> <em>Adams</em> climbed <em>Mount Kilimanjaro</em> while wearing a rhino 
              costume for the charity <em>Save the Rhino International</em>. <em>Adams</em> also had a passion 
              for technology. He brought his first word processor in <strong>1982</strong> which was a 
              <em>Nexu</em>. Shortly after in <strong>1984</strong> the <em>Macintosh</em> was released, of which 
              <em>Adams</em> was the first person in <em>Europe</em> to buy one and was an avid user and endorser 
              thereafter. <em>Adams</em> was also an atheist. Though he actually told people he was a 
              <em>"radical atheist"</em> so this was not confused with agnostic.

            <p class="p">
              <em>Douglas Adams</em> passed away on <strong>11th May 2001</strong> from a heart attack. 2 days 
              prior to his death the asteroid <em>18610</em> was named after <em>Hithhickers guide character 
              Auther Dent</em> and then in 2005 the asteroid <em>25924</em> was named <em>Douglas Adams</em>. In
              <strong>2002</strong> <em>The Salmon of Doubt</em> was published containing various writings by
              <em>Douglas Adams</em>, some of which were previously unpublished. <em>Adams</em> had said that he 
              wanted to write a sixth <em>Hitchhikers Guide</em> book as the ending to Mostly Harmless was quite 
              "bleak". This was later written by <em>Eoin Colfer</em> titled <em>And Another Thing......</em>, 
              which was released on <strong>12th October 2009</strong>. The legacy of Douglas Adams still 
              continues to this day through his writings and activism.
